# BrainWeaver documentation

 * [The BrainWeaver manual](Manual.md).

This material is not made for self-study, but it is used as supportive material on BrainWeaver training sessions.

The coding schemes are customized on the analysis of concept maps of students doing education or accountancy.
They cannot be used on other groups, as one needs to develop definition of 'completness', 'concretess' and 'specificity'.
